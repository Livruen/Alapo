# Alapo and other games 

### Two games that looks a little bit like chess

It was my homework in my university. 
I worked the first time with JavaFXSCeneBuilder 2.0 and JavaFX, so the code for the GUI part is pretty messy ;(
The design was made completely by myself.

Used design patterns:
- Strategy pattern - for the pawn behaviours
- MVC - for the GUI part
- Abstract Fabric - generates the pawns for the board

## Install
1. Clone or download the project.
2. You need JavaFX to run the GUI Game - here is a tutorial : http://download.java.net/general/javafx/eclipse/tutorial.html

## Run
Console game: fh.twoplay.games.PlayGame.java
Game with gui: fh.twoplay.gui.GuiBoard.java
